# 🚀 CodeBuddy – A Crowdsourced Problem-Solving Platform

## 🧠 Project Overview

**CodeBuddy** is an interactive, community-driven platform designed for programmers to post, discuss, and collaboratively solve coding-related challenges. The platform encourages peer-to-peer learning by allowing users to ask questions, submit answers, rate responses, and participate in structured discussions. With features like real-time updates, a voting system, and authentication, CodeBuddy aims to create a space for both beginners and experienced developers to learn and grow together.

## 🗓️ Capstone Daily Plan (21 Days)

| Day | Task |
|-----|------|
| Day 1 | Create a low-fidelity design (sketch UI layout and structure) |

| Day 3 | Set up GitHub project (initialize repo, README, project board, issues) |
| Day 4 | Start tracking daily tasks & milestones in GitHub Projects |
| Day 5 | Create and test **GET** API endpoints (fetch questions/answers) |
| Day 6 | Create and test **POST** API endpoints (add questions/answers) |
| Day 7 | Create and test **PUT** API endpoints (edit questions/answers) |
| Day 8 | Design and deploy the **backend server** (Express setup, nodemon, environment config) |
| Day 9 | Create **MongoDB schemas** for users, questions, and answers |
| Day 10 | Perform database read/write operations (CRUD with Mongoose) |
